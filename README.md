## Requirements

- **Node.js** and **pnpm** for Next.js development
- **Rust** and **Cargo** for Tauri development

For the best experience to build Readest for yourself, use a recent version of Node.js and Rust. Refer to the [Tauri documentation](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for details on setting up the development environment prerequisites on different platforms.

```bash
nvm install v22
nvm use v22
npm install -g pnpm
rustup update
```

## Getting Started

To get started with Readest, follow these steps to clone and build the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrox/readest.git
cd readest
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# might need to rerun this when code is updated
pnpm install
# copy pdfjs-dist to Next.js public directory
pnpm --filter @readest/readest-app setup-pdfjs
```

### 3. Verify Dependencies Installation

To confirm that all dependencies are correctly installed, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm tauri info
```

This command will display information about the installed Tauri dependencies and configuration on your platform. Note that the output may vary depending on the operating system and environment setup. Please review the output specific to your platform for any potential issues.

For Windows targets, “Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022” (or a higher edition of Visual Studio) and the “Desktop development with C++” workflow must be installed. For Windows ARM64 targets, the “VS 2022 C++ ARM64 build tools” and "C++ Clang Compiler for Windows" components must be installed. And make sure `clang` can be found in the path by adding `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin` for example in the environment variable `Path`.

### 4. Build for Development

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

### 5. Build for Production

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```
