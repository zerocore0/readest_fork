## Downloads

The Readest app is available for download! ü•≥ üöÄ

- macOS / iOS / iPadOS : Search for "Readest" on the [App Store][link-appstore], also available on TestFlight for beta test (send your Apple ID to readestapp@gmail.com to request access).
- Windows / Linux / Android: Visit [https://readest.com][link-website] or the [Releases on GitHub][link-gh-releases].
- Web: Visit [https://web.readest.com][link-web-readest].

## Requirements

- **Node.js** and **pnpm** for Next.js development
- **Rust** and **Cargo** for Tauri development

For the best experience to build Readest for yourself, use a recent version of Node.js and Rust. Refer to the [Tauri documentation](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for details on setting up the development environment prerequisites on different platforms.

```bash
nvm install v22
nvm use v22
npm install -g pnpm
rustup update
```

## Getting Started

To get started with Readest, follow these steps to clone and build the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/readest/readest.git
cd readest
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# might need to rerun this when code is updated
pnpm install
# copy pdfjs-dist to Next.js public directory
pnpm --filter @readest/readest-app setup-pdfjs
```

### 3. Verify Dependencies Installation

To confirm that all dependencies are correctly installed, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm tauri info
```

This command will display information about the installed Tauri dependencies and configuration on your platform. Note that the output may vary depending on the operating system and environment setup. Please review the output specific to your platform for any potential issues.

For Windows targets, ‚ÄúBuild Tools for Visual Studio 2022‚Äù (or a higher edition of Visual Studio) and the ‚ÄúDesktop development with C++‚Äù workflow must be installed. For Windows ARM64 targets, the ‚ÄúVS 2022 C++ ARM64 build tools‚Äù and "C++ Clang Compiler for Windows" components must be installed. And make sure `clang` can be found in the path by adding `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin` for example in the environment variable `Path`.

### 4. Build for Development

```bash
# Start development for the Tauri app
pnpm tauri dev
# or start development for the Web app
pnpm dev-web
```

For Android:

```bash
# Initialize the Android environment (run once)
pnpm tauri android init

pnpm tauri android dev
# or if you want to dev on a real device
pnpm tauri android dev --host
```

For iOS:

```bash
# Set up the iOS environment (run once)
pnpm tauri ios init

pnpm tauri ios dev
# or if you want to dev on a real device
pnpm tauri ios dev --host
```

### 5. Build for Production

```bash
pnpm tauri build
pnpm tauri android build
pnpm tauri ios build
```

### 6. Setup dev environment with Nix

If you have Nix installed, you can leverage flake to enter a development shell
with all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
nix develop ./ops  # enter a dev shell for the web app
nix develop ./ops#ios # enter a dev shell for the ios app
nix develop ./ops#android # enter a dev shell for the android app
```

### 7. More information

Please check the [wiki][link-gh-wiki] of this project for more information on development.
